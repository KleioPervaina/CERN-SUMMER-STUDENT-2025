Bunch-by-Bunch Luminosity Variations in the LHC:  Emittance Evolution and Beam Structure Effects
Folder contents:
- FILL 10709:
    - ATLAS fam movies: show the evolution of the distribution between 4 families in stable,
        - ATLAS_movies_b1 and b2: are the distributions for all 4 families
        - ATLAS_movies1 to 4 b1 and b2 are the distributions of each family with the ips
    - Beam_1_fill10709, similar for Beam_2_fill10709: intensity, emittance, luminosity for the 8 families
    - emittance_rates_B1, similar for emittance_rates_B2: emittance growth for fill 10709 for 8 families, injection, bridge and stable
    - FILL10709: analysis on the 4 family partition
    - fit_distribution: code for ATLAS fam movies for the distribution evolution of the 4 family partition
- Fills:
    - fit_on_all_fills: emittance growth of 8 family partition averaged over 14 fills with filling scheme '25ns_2460b_2448_2089_2227_144bpi_20inj'
    - ips: emittance growth of 8 family partition averaged over 14 fills, partitioned with ips
